  - How close is point to line?
  - Do two lines intersect?
  - Where do two lines intersect?
  - Is point in polygon?
    - Crossing / winding number
  - What is the area of a polygon?
- Line segment intersections
- Convex hull
- Closest pair of points
- Voronoi's algorithm (lol)
- Boolean ops on polygons
