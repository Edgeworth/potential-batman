The Assignment Problem - Hungarian Algorithm
O(n^3)

The Hungarian algorithm computes the **maximum weighted
matching** of a bipartite graph. You must use dummy nodes to
make both halves the same size, using 0-weight edges to
signify "unmatched"

To signify that pairs can't be matched, use edges with
weight -infinity and add *N* dummy nodes to each side with
0-weight edges (to allow nodes to be unmatched).

To compute the **minimum wieghted perfect matching** (such
as assigning workers to tasks most cheaply) simply negate
the edge weights. Dummy nodes still have 0-weight edges.
