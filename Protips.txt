Protips

- Write test cases for all cases you can think of.
- Clear all global state.
- Autoindent your code to look for misplaced braces / scope.
- Always do the diff.

- Don't dismiss a solution without proof.

- Run your algorithm by hand on sample input.
- Get more than one person to read each problem.
- When input strings could be blank, make sure you use
  getline rather than stream extraction.
- When using getline, call cin.peek() to force-update
  the eof bit before checking for the end of file.
